It was a pleasant evening, when my study was interrupted by a sudden vibration of my mobile device.
What this could mean, I wondered. For what reason would my evening be sullied by a interruption of this type?
Of course, I could do nothing but pick up my phone and find out. It was a text, of which contained an almost unbearably difficult question:

> Should a pepperoni roll be classified as a sandwich?

I toiled, and I thought, and I tumbled through this terribly tasty question.
I could not justify the pepperoni roll being brought to such levels as an ordinary sandwich, but yet neither could I stomach the thought that it be classified wrongly as merely a pastry.
But what other option was there?  Tremblingly, I came to my conclusion.

## A pepperoni roll is not a sandwich.

How could it be otherwise?  The platonic ideal of a sandwich cannot be applied to a pepperoni roll.
As our definition of the sandwich is in modern english,

> An article of food for a light meal or snack, composed of two thin slices of bread, 
> usually buttered, with a savoury or other filling. 
> ...
> Occasionally with only one slice of bread, as in open sandwich or open-faced sandwich, or with biscuits, sliced buns, or cake.
>
> -- Oxford English Dictionary[^1]

Do you see it?  **Two** pieces of bread.  There is no world in which we could say that a proper pepperoni roll is made with two pieces of bread.
Now, don't think I'm naive or unattentive, I do see the second defintion.  The open sandwich does specify one piece of bread can be used.
However, a pepperoni roll certainly cannot fit the description of a open sandwich.  The meat is entirely internal to it.

## Conclusion

Now that I have belabored the point in many more words than the question deserves, I may go back to my peaceful evening.
Perhaps I shall go find a pepperoni roll to celebrate my victory.
